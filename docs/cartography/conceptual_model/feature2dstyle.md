# Abstract

This document proposes a set of concrete extensions of the Symbology Conceptual Core Model standard to control how 2D features data (eg. vector layer) are rendered.



# Overview



The FeatureTypeStyle extensions provide a set of concrete Symbology Core Model implementations to renderer 2D features (eg. vector data). 

The extensions are organized as packages (Figure 1).
